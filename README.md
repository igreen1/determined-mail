Many mail services’ interfaces appear to lack consideration towards people with dyslexia and other sight/language-based disabilities. Dyslexia is a disorder in which reading is difficult due to problems with identifying speech sounds and learning how speech sounds relate to letters and words. When it comes to web-development, there are many ways to make sure that the content and design is accessible to users with dyslexia and other sight/language-based disabilities. Unfortunately, mail services’ interfaces still lack such accessibility features.  

Determined Mail is a redesigned email service interface that will be based on both the previous research that has been done regarding website users with dyslexia as well as the results from our survey. It aims to be more clean, more organized, and less text based than existing email services.
